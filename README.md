Complexity ANalysis: detetmining how efficient an algowithn is. Usually involves finding both the time complexity and the space complexity of an algowithm.

Time Complexity: A measure of how fast an algowithm runs, time complexity is a central concept in the field of algowithms and in coding interviews. It is expressed in Big O notation.

Space Complexity: A measure of how much auxiliary memory an algorithm takes up, space complexity is a central concept in the field of algorithms and in coding interviews.  It is expressed using Big O notation.
