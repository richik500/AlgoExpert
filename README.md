Complexity ANalysis: detetmining how efficient an algowithn is. Usually involves finding both the time complexity and the space complexity of an algowithm.

Time Complexity: A measure of how fast an algowithm runs, time complexity is a central concept in the field of algowithms and in coding interviews. It is expressed in Big O notation.

Space Complexity: A measure of how much auxiliary memory an algorithm takes up, space complexity is a central concept in the field of algorithms and in coding interviews.  It is expressed using Big O notation.

Bit, Byte. Fixed-Width Integer: An integer represented by a fixed amount of bits. For example a 32-bit integer is an integer represented by 32 bits (4 bytes). Regardless of how large an integer is, an operation performed on its fixed-wodth integer representation consists of a constant number of bit manipulations, since the integer is made uo of a fixed number of bits.

Memory: foundational layer of computing where all data is stored. Stored in bytes and by extension, bits. Bytes in memory can point to other bytes in memory, so as to store references to other data. Acessing a byter or a fixed number of bytes is an elementary operation, which can be loosely treated as a single unit of operational work.
